# Lestora Highlights

The highlight mod is meant to highlight particular blocks.  It does this for two specific cases:

## Features
- **Highlight Shape**:  Highlights solid blocks within a specified radius sphere. This is a personal test tool I used to get the mod published with some functionality. I use it to "dig a crater". It doesn't actually do anything, but it highlights where you should dig to keep a spherical hole.
- **Highlight Light Emissions**:  This will review nearby spaces and find light-emitting blocks like torches and glowstone.  It will then highlight the boundaries with smart features like tracking, melding nearby light source boundaries, and more.  It will also suggest where you should place new light sources to maximize torch use.

When calculating the Light Emissions, it will show a few different things.
1. The yellow/black markers which show how far the light emits for each nearby light source
2. Blue "boxes" for the next best location to place distant light sources, specifically in a straight line.
3. Green "boxes" for suggested places to put a new light source to "fill in gaps".  This will actually use whatever light source you're holding in your hand to help calculate!

## Dependency
The latest version of this mod depends on Lestora Config, version 1.1.2.

## Manual Installation
1. Download the mod JAR from CurseForge.
2. Place the JAR file into your `mods` folder.
3. Launch Minecraft with the Forge profile.

## Commands
- Use the command `/lestora createSphere <radius>` to highlight a spherical area of breakable blocks from your current location.
- Use the command `/lestora clearHighlights` For debug, especially early in development.  Clears whole-block highlights like torch suggestions and spherical highlights.
- Use the command `/lestora lights showAllBoundaries [true/false]` Default true, set to false to show all boundaries of all light sources.  It's not pretty, but good for debugging.
- Use the command `/lestora lights scanDistance <radius 5-100>` Default 41.  The distance around the player to scan for light sources for which to draw boundaries.
- Use the command `/lestora lights updateFrequency <radius 1-100>` Default 2.  Every "how many seconds" the light area will be re-mapped, assuming you're moving in and out of range of other light sources.
- Use the command `/lestora lights showWhenStanding [true/false]` Default false.  Will show the calculated light area while just walking around (updates at updateFrequency above)
- Use the command `/lestora lights showWhenCrouching [true/false]` Default true.  Will show the calculated light area while crouching.

## Compatibility
